# Enhancing the User Experience
### Digital Humanities 150 - Spring 2020
### Created by Hunter Harralson

There are many websites I frequent based on personal interests. For many of these, there are details I notice that would make my experience as a user much smoother. With this project, I am looking to improve a website that I feel I would use more with minor improvements. 


## Case 1: <a href="http://letterboxd.com" target="_blank"> Letterboxd </a> :movie_camera:

A website that serves as a social platform for cinephiles, Letterboxd allows a user to log viewed films, leave lengthy film reviews, rate movies, and discuss movies with friends and strangers. It serves as a medium for people to interact about the movies they love, hate, or simply want to share with their following.

I have been a Letterboxd user for around a year now, but I do not use it as frequently as I would like to. I think that part of this is because of the user experience. If I want to view information about a film, I am more likely to go to IMDB because I am more familiar with using it. Letterboxd is a very overwhelming experience for a new user. While it is obvious that many user experience principles have been thoughtfully considered, more minute details that aggregate throughout the experience can make it frustrating for a user like myself who desires the engagement the platform offers.
