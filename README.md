# Enhancing the User Experience
### Digital Humanities 150 - Spring 2020
### Created by Hunter Harralson

There are many websites I frequent based on personal interests. For many of these, there are details I notice that would make my experience as a user much smoother. With this project, I am looking to improve a website that I feel I would use more with minor improvements. 


## Case 1: <a href="http://letterboxd.com" target="_blank"> Letterboxd </a> :movie_camera:

A website that serves as a social platform for cinephiles, Letterboxd allows a user to log viewed films, leave lengthy film reviews, rate movies, and discuss movies with friends and strangers. It serves as a medium for people to interact about the movies they love, hate, or simply want to share with their following.

I have been a Letterboxd user for around a year now, but I do not use it as frequently as I would like to. I think that part of this is because of the user experience. If I want to view information about a film, I am more likely to go to IMDB because I am more familiar with using it. Letterboxd is a very overwhelming experience for a new user. While it is obvious that many user experience principles have been thoughtfully considered, more minute details that aggregate throughout the experience can make it frustrating for a user like myself who desires the engagement the platform offers.

# Heurisitc Evaluation
* **Visibility of system status**: providing nuggets of information (feedback) that allow users to accurately assess the current state of the system.

* **Match between system and the real world**: the system should speak to the userâ€™s real world, via language, phrases, and concepts that are familiar.

* **User control and freedom**: if a user makes a mistake, they should be able to go back to the previous page or homepage easily without having to take many steps.

* **Consistency and standards**: the same actions should remain the same throughout an app/website via using the same words and icons; internal and external consistency need to be maintained.

* **Error prevention**: notifying and offering users a way out of an error that may be made.

* **Recognition rather than recall**: users need more context-provided cues to make something a recognition process and not a taxing recall process.

* **Flexibility and efficiency of use**: an action can be carried out in a number of different ways, with efficiency potentially increasing for a more experienced user; user can choose their method of interaction.

* **Aesthetic and minimalist design**: remove unnecessary elements as they only compete with the essential information; reduce the noise to increase the signal.

* **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**: error messages should concisely and clearly indicate the error and how the user can fix it.

* **Help and Documentation**: allow users to find their problem, and then list concrete steps that they can carry out to solve the issue.
