# DH150 Assignment 6: Low Fidelity Prototype
Hunter Harralson

# Overview
* **Desription** - The purpose of this project is to enhance the social atmosphere on the Letterboxd website. Simply put, Letterboxd is a platform that allows film lovers to share thoughts and feelings on films with one another. For me, I see the potenital of the website to serve as a niche for cinephiles to interact with one another, but I feel that something about the website hinders the full capability of the social side. That is why for this project, I have focused on enhancing that aspect of Letterboxd. 
* **Purpose** - The purpose of the low fidelity prototype is for me to simply visualize ideas and be able to test the usability of these implementations in a low-cost setting where I can easily apply fixes later. Ideally, by the end of this stage of development, there will be a base structure that can be turned into a high-fidelity prototype. In creating and testing these prototypes, it is determined whether or not a product is usable. 
* **Features** - The features represented in this prototype are features that, through research and usability testing, were deemed useful additions in improving the social aspect of Letterboxd. The first feature is the inclusion of an activity page that is separated based on reviews and posts, thus allowing more informal posts about films. Then there is the personal messaging option between users, something that would increase sharing of information. And finally, there is an improved user profile page that includes a button to message and the display of posts and reviews in a timeline fashion. 

# Wireframes
In bringing to life my low fidelity prototype, I created wireframes of the three basic screens associated with the previously listed features.

# Wireflows
In order to test the usability of the prototype, I asked my roommate to perform tasks using the simple wireframes. 
* **Task 1**: Navigate to the activity page to share a review. Then view the review amongst your posts.

* **Feedback**: Following the task, I asked my friend what he found useful and what did not work as well. The important thing I took away was keeping the activity page simple and familiar to other social media platforms so that the user doesn't have to learn new skills to navigate the website. He also added that having a picture of the film being discussed may help the user visually parse through the activity page looking for films that may catch his or her eye. This I later added to the wireframe. 
* **Task 2**: Search a film, find a review from your friend, and message that friend.

* **Feedback**: Following the second task, I could see the gears turning a bit more in my friend's head. This was most apparant on the film's page, as finding the review is much harder with the large number of information on the page. 

# Summary
Coming into this process, I was excited to actually start the design process of the ideas that had arisen from weeks of research. I think one thing that caught me by surprise was the amount of detail that actually occurs in working designs and how much we take them for granted. For example, I almost forgot to include a 'New Post' feature on the activity page, which is arguably the most important part. I also think that it is important to not get too absorbed in the minutiae of the design just yet, because those details will be handled as higher fidelity prototypes are developed. This showed me that the low fidelity protoype is very helpful in identifying the essential features that make the experience flow the correct way. The process has been eye-opening for me, as it has allowed me to both implement the features visually and also see how they behave.
