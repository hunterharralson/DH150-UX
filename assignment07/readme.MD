# DH150 High-Fidelity Prototype - 
*Created by Hunter Harralson*
# Description of Project
My project is based on the website <a href="http://letterboxd.com" target="_blank"> Letterboxd </a>, which is a social platform for people who regularly watch and keep up with films. As my friends and myself often use the website, we have discussed the minute flaws that lead up to a lessened experience, so when the time came to choose a project, this seemed like the right choice.

Through user research, I was able to identify a few features that could greatly improve the social experience of being a Letterboxd user. Primarily, the activity page stands out as overcrowded and difficult to navigate. For a platform aimed at being social, my interviewee from the usability testing phase noted that he often avoids the activity page because of its cluttered state. He mentioned that giving formal film reviews their own section separate from shorter posts about films would give him a greater sense of control over the content he sees. 

The high fidelity prototype stage was very exciting for me, as I was able to transfer my low fidelity wireframes into something functional. Initially, the process was very useful for me as the designer to see features I may have overlooked in my wireframe creation. More importantly, the end prototype’s functionality allows one to perform user testing on the product to further improve it. With more feedback comes more iteration, thus leading to a more effective product. For the high fidelity prototype, I took my wireframes into Figma to demonstrate three major user scenarios: 

*1. Browse shorter posts from the activity page and share one of these posts.
*2. Create a post and view this post on the activity page.
*3. Navigate from the activity page to a user’s profile, and send the user a personal message.
