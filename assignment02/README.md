## Introduction
<a href="http://letterboxd.com" target="_blank"> Letterboxd </a> is a website that serves as a social platform for cinephiles, Letterboxd allows a user to log viewed films, leave lengthy film reviews, rate movies, and discuss movies with friends and strangers. It serves as a medium for people to interact about the movies they love, hate, or simply want to share with their following.

Usability Testing is a method to evaluate how a given website or application is interacted with by its users. In testing how a user completes routine tasks, the user-centered design can be greatly improved. A usability test is conducted with a group of potential users in three typical settings: a usability lab, remotely, or on-site using portable equipment. These sessions are recorded, with their data analyzed to help identify potential improvements to the website or application.

I conducted a usability test of the website Letterboxd, using a live version of the website while testing my roommate remotely. With my roommate using ActivePresenter software to both screen record and face record, along with us connecting via FaceTime for me to give him instructions, the usability test was conducted. The test was designed to capture the participant's navigational choices, comments, satisfaction ratings, and general feedback; however, some of these facets were lost due to technical diffulties with the software. Luckily, as administrator/moderator, I was very attentive and taking notes of the test and responses.
